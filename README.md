# GBIF data licenses

## Rationale

Data publishers of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ([GBIF](http://www.gbif.org)) apply a wide range licenses to their datasets. This is [problematic](http://peterdesmet.com/posts/illegal-bullfrogs.html):

* Users of the data need to investigate and understand those licenses before they can use the data.
* Many licenses don't comply with the practices of GBIF and/or open data, limiting the use of the data.

We want to get an overview of all data licenses used in GBIF registered datasets and translate those to standard licenses where possible.
